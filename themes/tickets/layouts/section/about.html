      <p>Since <span class="highlight">2018</span>, I've been collecting movie tickets as a way to capture memories and experiences across theaters near and far. What began with an average ticket price of just <span class="highlight">¥10.0</span> has grown into a collection of <span class="highlight">{{ printf "%d" $totalItems }}</span> tickets, with an average ticket price of <span class="highlight">${{ printf "%.2f" $averagePrice }}</span>. In total, I've currently spent roughly <span class="highlight">${{ printf "%.2f" $totalSpent }}</span> on movie tickets. While most tickets are from theaters in Beijing, this collection also includes stubs from screenings in far-off places like <a href="/tickets/theaters/sfx-cinema-maya-chiang-mai/">Chiang Mai, Thailand</a>, <a href="/tickets/theaters/tgv-cinemas-suria-klcc/">Malaysia</a>, and <a href="/tickets/theaters/the-projector/">Singapore</a>. Each ticket represents a unique cinematic moment, spanning genres, cultures, and locations around the globe.</p>
